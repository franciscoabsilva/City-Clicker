# City Clicker  
Final Project for Human-Computer Interaction

## Introduction  
City Clicker is a web-based game designed to enhance user performance in clicker-style challenges by optimizing reaction speed and decision-making. All targets (representing different cities) are displayed on the screen at all times. The objective is to quickly identify and click on the correct city based on the prompt shown at the bottom of the screen. The project focuses on creating a fast-paced, visually intuitive experience that rewards accuracy and quick thinking.

## How to Play  
At the bottom of the screen, the name of a city is displayed. Your task is to quickly locate and click the corresponding target (city) from the options on the screen. The faster and more accurately you click, the better your performance.

## Running the Project
